         Bio
    </h3>
    <p>
         I'm this guy who likes to make games and stuff in his freetime.<br>
         I'm self-taught (by the internet) and am not a good coder in any way shape of form.<br>
         <span class="underline">but I like it.</span><br>
         I started off on scratch some years ago and gradually moved up.<br>
         I only have one 'official game' that I finished and has it's own site.<br>
         (disclaimer: it's not that good.)<br>
         <a href="https://vnms.github.io/platformer">the game.</a><br>
         I'm working on another game that will be much better.<br>
         It's a sandbox survival game with spaceships, kind of like a 2d space engineers.<br>
         It's called xplr but I won't give the link yet. I am slowly making that better.<br>
         I use HTML, CSS, and JS to code most of the time.<br>
         My favorite is javascript and I use the canvas for all of my games.<br>
         Other languages I know are python, processing, and java.
         I want to learn c++ one day.

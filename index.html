              <h3>things I made: </h3>
              <a href="https://aethercode.github.io/platformer">platformer (2016)</a><br>
              I made this a while back. It's pretty bad and unfinished. If I revisited this, I could put a lot more effort in now.<br>
              <a href="https://aethercode.github.io/xplr">xplr (abandoned)</a><br>
              I did a lot of basic work for this, and then gave up on this. The idea was cool, I just didn't have the patience to execute it. It was going to be a spaceship building and fighting game.<br>
              <a href="https://aethercode.github.io/NovelWriter/">novelwriter (2016)</a><br>
              This is a pretty functional book writing program, but it isn't practical due to it being in html and having no way to conveniently save. If this got made into a desktop app, it would be usable.<br>
              <a href="https://aethercode.github.io/expression-generator/">expression generator (2018)</a><br>
              A goofy little program that generates sentences that follow "that really [verb]s my [noun]."<br>
              <a href="https://aethercode.github.io/MinimalWriter/">minimalwriter (2016)</a><br>
              A tiny little writing app. Super simple, just for writing stuff quickly in a simple UI.
